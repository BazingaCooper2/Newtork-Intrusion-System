## Open Source & GSoC-Style Contributions

This project explores **Network Intrusion Detection using Machine Learning** as part of my open-source learning and research journey.  
It applies supervised and unsupervised ML models to detect malicious network traffic patterns and anomalies.

### Highlights:
- Developed and trained models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks) for detecting intrusions in network traffic datasets (e.g., KDD, CICIDS).
- Built preprocessing pipelines for feature engineering, scaling, and dataset balancing.
- Implemented a modular structure for easy extension by the open-source community.
- Actively preparing contributions and proposals for **Google Summer of Code (GSoC)** and other security-focused open-source initiatives.

### Contributions:
- Plan to contribute enhancements (model optimization, benchmarking scripts) to **open-source intrusion detection frameworks**.
- Will share PRs and code contributions to related security and ML projects soon.
